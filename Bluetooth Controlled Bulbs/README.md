# Bluetooth Controlled Bulbs #

Arduino code for a system to turn on/off three light bulbs using a mobile app via Bluetooth. Used MIT App Inventor to develop the app. The bulbs were controlled by an Arduino. A Bluetooth module was used to receive data from the phone. The three light bulbs were connected in parallel to the Arduino using relays.

This repo contains all the code required for this project.
