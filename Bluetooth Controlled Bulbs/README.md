# Bluetooth Controlled Bulbs #

In this project, we built a system to turn on or off three light bulbs using a mobile app via bluetooth. Used MIT App Inventor to develop the app. All the logic in the in the bulb's side were programmed into an Arduino board. A bluetooth module was used to receive data from the phone. The three light bulbs were connected in parallel to the Arduino board using relays.

This repo contains all the code required for this project.
